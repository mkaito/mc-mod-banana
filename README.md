# Banana For Scale

Ever wanted to measure your minecraft base in Bananas? Me neither. But now you can do it anyway.

## Usage

Craft a Banana For Scale. Shift right-click a block to set the anchor block.
Then, any time you right-click another block, you will be told how many bananas
are between them, measured in International Average Bananas, IAB for short.

There's also an edible banana that has a chance to make you float and glow
a tiny bit.
